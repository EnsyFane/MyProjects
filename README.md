# MyProjects
A list of projects you can download to see my work.
If you want to see the sourcecode of any project email me and we can talk about it.

# Cyberpunk 2018
This game was developed in **Greenfoot** by me and a friend during a Greenfoot contest hosted by AdFaber(https://adfaber.org/) in the spring of 2018.
The game recieved the maximum amount of points during the first stage and we ended up in 14th place in the second stage. There were over 110 teams that participated in the contest.
The game is a 2D-Platformer that requires you to answer various general knowledge questions. We had our classmates test the game and that made us understand how to filter feedback.
It was our first serious encounter with **Java** and teamworking thus the end-product is a bit rough around the edges and could have been more polished.
Overall it was a great learning experience from a programming standpoint.

# Evolight
This game was developed in **Unity** for a programming skill certificate. I developed the game in the spring of 2019 to prove my skills in **C#**.
I recieved the maximum grade on this project during the assessment. During the development of this game i used all my skills in game design.
Besides the core gameplay elements I have also added a map generator to easily add new levels. This feature is only available in the unity editor.
It is a wave-shooter with the last level being endless. You progress through a set of weapons that get progressively better while the enemies become stronger with each level.
The game is a bit on the hard side but many of my classmates managed to get to the last level and enjoyed the experience.

# Planet Generator
This project is used to create planet prefabs for **Unity** games. They are best suited for far away shots but the code can be expanded to support close up shots. Using this generally allows you to create custom planets, but since this is one of my first projects I have ever "completed" it doesn't support use out of the editor. I considered making a "Game" but that would be pretty useless since you would only want to create planets for a game in the editor. This project is made to be used in combination with other projects.
**Example**: You want to create a game where you live on an alien planet and you need to create a moon for that planet. Since modeling the moon would be pretty time costing you could use this project and precedurally create the moon by simply inputing some values in 1 script and choosing the colors.
The planet generator allows for: **custom shapes** (this is realized using layered **perlin noise**) and **custom colors** (using a biome system where different heights represent different biomes, each biome allows a gradient to be used for colors).
