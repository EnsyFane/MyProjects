# Cyberpunk 2018
This game was developed in Greenfoot by me and a friend during a Greenfoot contest hosted by AdFaber(https://adfaber.org/) in the spring of 2018.
The game recieved the maximum amount of points during the first stage and we ended up in 14th place in the second stage. There were over 110 teams that participated in the contest.
The game is a 2D-Platformer that requires you to answer various general knowledge questions. We had our classmates test the game and that made us understand how to filter feedback.
It was our first serious encounter with Java and teamworking thus the end-product is a bit rough around the edges and could have been more polished.
Overall it was a great learning experience from a programming standpoint.
